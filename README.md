# Quote Sentimentalyzer
Check out the ReactJS frontend for this project at https://github.com/daphinora/Quotes_frontend.

Welcome to The Quote Sentimentalyzer! The Quote Sentimentalyzer encourages a user to save quotes to a collection and then analyze their overall sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) based on the quotes the user has selected. The Quote Sentimentalyzer was a mod 3 project by three students at Flatiron School, and thus has met MVP (minimum viable product) representation but not been further planned upon.

Want to try the app? Make sure you clone this repo, cd into this directory, and then run `bundle install && rails s` (and don't forget to run the frontend on another port, too!)

Stretch goals for this project include:
- Fixing the styling/buttons
- Allowing users to add their own quotes
- Allowing users to create multiple collections
- Allowing users to view other users' collections
- Implementing user authentication
